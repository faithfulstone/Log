    <h1>This is the beginning</h1>

    <p>Date: May 28 2022</p>
    <p>Today I will be doing lesson 23 and 24 in Colt Steels Udemy Course. Section 23 is about new JS features and
        Section 24 is an introduction to the dom</p>

    <h2>Notes Section 23</h2>
    <p>... Spreads an array to make all the values in the array an argument for whatever function you are passing it
        into. Destructuring arrays and objects is interesting and I can see how its usefull if you dont want to use dot
        syntex, you can also destructure objects and arrays in the paramaters if you dont want to pass in the entire
        object/array</p>

    <h2>Notes Section 24: The world of DOM</h2>
    <p>Window is an object that covers the entire page. console.dir(document) shows big object, console.dir() shows the
        html object, innerText changes text.
        Everything in the dom is an object/object representation. getElementByTagName selects all of the objects with
        the tag you specified. Then you can loop over them with for of. Ids should only occur once per page, use classes
        and tags if you want to select multiple objects. querySelector only gets first object :nth of type can be used to get a specific one
    </p>
